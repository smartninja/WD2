# Lesson 21 - Recap & final project planning

This lesson is again intended to go through some of the students' questions and solve their problems and issues that they've come across in the recent lessons. As before, all software-development questions are valid and encouraged.

When students' questions are exhausted, we can skim through the lessons that we had in this  section and refresh the memory. Some of the questions from the previous lessons to start a conversation could be:

## Final project planning

The coming 3 lessons are planned for the final project. There is a lot of flexibility for the final project, each student can do their own project, they can do it in groups or the entire group can do one. The project can be done by students individually and the mentor only offers support or we can be working on the project together, where the mentor writes the code and explains possible questions and the students instruct the mentor what to write.

The topic of the project is also up to the group to decide. The goal of this final project is to give the students the opportunity to develop a web app that's useful for them or someone they know. At the end the App should be deployed online and reachable by anyone who would like to use it.

The project can be an improvement of an existing (open-source) project, or a new app developed from scratch. I'll give some possible ideas for the app, but use the time on this lesson to brainstorm and think about what kind of app you would like to work on.

### Ideas for the final project app

- A pomodoro timer

- A personal notes app or a personal finance manager

- An exchange rate price tracker

- A travel wishlist map

- [A map of trees](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/tree-map/tree/2150847)

- A weekly dinner menu planer

- An implementation of a game, a quiz or a puzzle

- ...
