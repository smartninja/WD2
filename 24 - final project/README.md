# Lesson 24 - Final project 3/3

In this lesson we'll finish the work from the previous two lessons. Depending on the group, the mentor and the project that was chosen, the mentor might just give feedback and answer the students' questions or they will work together developing the app.

## Final thoughts

Over the past two courses, you’ve built a solid foundation in web development — from structuring pages with HTML and styling them with CSS to bringing them to life with JavaScript and basic back-end concepts. You’ve learned how the pieces fit together to create functional, user-friendly and modern websites and web apps.

With these skills, you can now start building your own projects, customize existing websites, or maybe even start working on a junior web development job. More importantly, you’ve experienced the mindset of a developer — problem-solving, experimenting, and continuously learning.

As a next step, consider diving deeper into areas that spark your interest: explore frameworks like React or Vue, learn back-end technologies such as Node.js or Python, or start contributing to open-source projects. Keep practicing, stay curious, and keep building — every project you create will take you one step closer to becoming a confident, full-stack developer.
